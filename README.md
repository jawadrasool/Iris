# Analysis of Iris Dataset

The **Iris dataset** is a multivariate dataset introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936. More information about this can be found on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set).

The dataset contains 150 observations of iris species/classes, 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (*Iris setosa*, *Iris virginica* and *Iris versicolor*). Four features are recorded for each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. 
    
The dataset is publically available at [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris). It is also available within the packages scikit-learn and seaborn.

Our analysis consists of the following steps:

- We first take a look at the content of the data set, i.e. its size, number of coloumns, summary statistics etc. 

- Then we create various plots, i.e. Scatter plots, histograms, box plots, violin plots, pair plots to verify various aspects of this dataset.

 - Finally, we perform data modeling, and created many classification algorithms. We compare the performance based on the accuracy.

The analysis is in a jupyter notebook, which can be downloded and run easily from local machine.
