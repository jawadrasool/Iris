Analysis of Iris Dataset

The **Iris dataset** is a multivariate dataset introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936. More information about this can be found on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set).

The dataset contains 150 observations of iris species/classes, 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features are recorded for each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

The dataset is publically available at UCI Machine Learning Repository. It is also available within the packages scikit-learn and seaborn.

In this analysis, we take a look at the content of the data set, i.e. its size, summary statistics etc. 

Then we create various plots, i.e. Scatter plots, histograms, box plots, violin plots, pair plots to verify various aspects of this dataset.

Finally, we perform data modeling, and created many classification algorithms. We compare the performance based on the accuracy.
